/*
Karatsuba Algorithm
-------------------
The Karatsuba algorithm is a fast multiplication algorithm. It reduces the multiplication 
of two n-digit numbers to at most single-digit multiplications in general. It is 
therefore faster than the classical algorithm. The Karatsuba algorithm was the first 
multiplication algorithm asymptotically faster than the quadratic "grade school" algorithm.

Time Complexity : O(n^1.59)
