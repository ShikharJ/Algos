Quick Sort
----------
Quicksort or Partition-Exchange Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm, serving as a systematic method 
for placing the elements of an array in order. Developed by Tony Hoare (ACM Turing Award Recipient), 
it is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. When implemented well, it can be about two or three 
times faster than its main competitors, merge sort and heapsort.
Use order = +/- 1 for increasing and decreasing orders respectively.
