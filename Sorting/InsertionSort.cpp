/*
Insertion Sort
--------------
A simple sorting algorithm that builds a final sorted list by
placing individual elements at their relative ordered places
one at a time. Most efficient O(n^2) time sorting algorithm.
Efficient for data sets that are already substantially sorted,
the time complexity is O(nk) when each element in the input is 
no more than k places away from its sorted position.
--------------
Time Complexity: Best Case: O(n)
                 Average and Worst Case: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Stable: Yes
In-Place: Yes
Online: Yes
